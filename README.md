# House Price Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on features like living area, bedrooms, bathrooms, lot area, overall quality, and year built.  
A Streamlit web app is included to interactively make predictions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data files  
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory data analysis and model development notebooks  
- `src/`: Python scripts including `app.py` (Streamlit app)  
- `models/`: Trained model files  
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies  

## Usage

1. Setup your environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Run the Streamlit web app**  
Launch your app from the terminal:
streamlit run src/app.py


## Model and Data

- The model is trained using features extracted from the provided dataset.
- Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` contain the analysis, data cleaning, and model training steps.
